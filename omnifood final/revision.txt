Make website responsive:- 

1. fluid layout :-
use % vh or vw instead of px 

2. responsiv unit 
user rem instead of px 

3. responsive image
use different image for different divice
or use % for image dimention

4. Media query
bring responsive sites to life

==========================================
we first make website for laptop and then tablet and then mobile 

=============================================================================================

How rem and max with work 

if we use width instead of max width and open web page in mobile a downside scroll bar is created. 
which we don't want so we use max width.

if viewport width go below 1000 it start reducing its width.
==================

by Default 1rem is equal to 16px.
We can change the default value of rem in html elemnet 
like this 
html {
  /* font-size: 10px; */
  /* 10px / 16px =  0.625 =  62.5% */
  /* percentage of user browser font size  */
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
we use % because some time user make chnage in their browser font size and px can create problem for him.
===========================================================================================================
use ion icon 


overflow -hidden propery hide everything which is hiding our current element 

===============================
we can use caption and figure caption for gallery 

====
inline image have space between them but block doesn't have any 



========================================
Breakpoint :-
600px
900px
1200px


or
by testing 
change when desing break down for your website


=====================================
meta tage of view point in html is necessary for good design 

=====================================
we can select element using attribute also like this 

.icon-mobile-nav[name="close-outline"]{
  display: none;
}

when we write display to none then it does not allowed the transition

so you can use this:- 
    /* hide visibility */
    opacity: 0;
    /* make is unaccesisble to mouse and keyborad */
    pointer-events: none;
    /* hide it from screen reader */
    visibility: hidden;



    and to return them:- 
     opacity: 1;
    pointer-events: auto;
    visibility: visible;



    =================================================
    to make scrolling working on the page we first add id to the section where we want to move when we click any button linked to that element 
    and on the button inside href="#id" write like this. It well redirect you to that section when you click on the button.



    ======================================================
    the above button move the viewport to that particular section that you attached with the link.
    but we want smooth scrolling so we add this line in our css html tag
    scroll-behavior: smooth;

    some brwoser like safari does not support this smooth scrolling property so need to implement in js .
    =========================================================
    .sticky {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
to make any section fixed 
==============================================================
//optimise your code for suffari 

==============================================================
:- test and optimise 
browser :- chrome, safari, firefox,edge
 actual mobile not only dev tools
 optimise all image 
fix accessibility (color contrast ratio)
runlight house performance test 
seo 



=============================================================
adding meta tag and facicon 

before the meta width property in head 
  <meta
      name="description"
      content="A healthy meal delivered to your door, every single day. The smart 365-days-per-year food subscription that will make you eat healthy again."
    />


    and add favicon in the head like this 
     <link rel="icon" href="img/favicon.png" />
